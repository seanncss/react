% Might be prompted with:

% Type 'y' for yes

% If you see a warning that tar is deprecated, do the following to update it
npm i tar

% Do the above for any other deprecated warnings


% You should see:
Success! Created my-app at /Users/seann/React/my-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-app
  npm start


% CMD+c to stop the server

% When you’re ready to deploy to production, running npm run build will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder. You can learn more about Create React App from its README and the User Guide.
